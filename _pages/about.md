I am a Research Fellow at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and the ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies at the University of Melbourne. Before this, I was a Research Scientist (Senior Data Scientist) at IBM Research Melbourne. My research focuses on applying machine learning and data science techniques to large and complex healthcare data, especially related to human genomics and longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease.
